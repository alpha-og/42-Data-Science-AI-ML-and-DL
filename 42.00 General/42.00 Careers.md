## Data Engineer
- Companies possess a live running database (Online Transaction Process — OLTP) to which new data is continuously being added to
- It is not reliable or stable to perform data analysis on the OLTP directly as any mistakes could hamper the functionality of the service/ product
- Instead of using data from the OLTP directly, a data warehouse (Online Analytical Processing — OLAP) is created using the data from the OLTP
- Thus, on a fundamental level, Data Engineers make data available for analysis, ML and other tasks. The field is not necessarily related to data science
- **Responsibilities:**
	1. Scrape data from available sources
	2. Move/ store the data in optimal servers/ warehouses
	3. Build data pipelines/ APIs for easy access to the data
	4. Handle or maintain databases/ data-warehouses
- **Skills Required:**
	1. Strong knowledge of DSA
	2. Programming Languages (Java/ R/ Python/ Scala and scripting) (one or more)
	3. Advanced DBMS (SQL and NoSQL)
	4. Big Data Tools (Apache Spark, Hadoop, Apache Kafka, Apache Hive)
	5. Cloud Platforms (AWS, GCP)
	6. Distributed Systems
	7. Data Pipelines
- **Difficulty:** High (suitable for hardcore software engineers)
## Data Analyst
- Data Analysts are required to make inferences from already available data 
- **Responsibilities:**
	1. Cleaning and organising raw data
	2. Deriving insights by analysing data
	3. Creating data visualisations
	4. Producing and maintaining reports
	5. Collaborating with teams using insight gained
	6. Optimising data collection procedures
- **Skills Required:**
	1. Statistical Programming
	2. Programming Languages (R/ SAS/ Python)
	3. Creative and analytical thinking
	4. Business acumen (intermediate to advanced knowledge of business)
	5. Strong communication skills
	6. Data mining, cleaning and munging
	7. Data visualisation
	8. Data story telling
	9. SQL
	10. Advanced spreadsheets
## Data Scientist
- Data scientists are required to take on the role of data engineers and data analysts simultaneously
- Data scientists target predictive modelling in addition to the aforementioned roles
- Responsibilities and skills required are similar to that of data engineer and data analyst
## ML Engineer
- ML engineers help with deployment of ML models as a product
- **Responsibilities**
	1. Deployment of ML models to production ready environments
	2. Scaling and optimising the model
	3. Monitoring and maintenance of deployed models
- **Skills Required:**
	1. Mathematics
	2. Programming Languages (R/ Python/ Java/ Scala)
	3. Distributed Systems
	4. Data model and evaluation
	5. ML models
	6. Software engineering and systems design
