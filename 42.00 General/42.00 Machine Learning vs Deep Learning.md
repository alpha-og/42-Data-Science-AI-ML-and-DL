# Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
---
> [!tip] Algorithms
> While in upcoming sections, certain examples of algorithms are mentioned specifically against ML and DL, respectively, these are not set in stone and we may use the algorithms in either ML or DL depending on what the problem at hand demands
## Machine Learning
- ML typically makes use of statistics to identify patterns in data and make predictions
- Machine Learning is typically suitable for application on structured data
- **Structured data** is data that is available in the form of spreadsheets, tables, etc...
- for structured data algorithms such as `XGBoost`, `random forests` or other tree based algorithms
- ML can be applied in scenarios where fuzzy logic is required
- It is important to consider that ML often requires features to be clearly defined
- The prediction accuracy of ML algorithms plateaus after a certain point and does not indefinitely increase with increase in available data
### Common ML Algorithms
- Examples
	- Random forest
	- Gradient boosted models
	- Naive Bayes
	- Nearest neighbour
	- Support vector machine
- These are often referred to as shallow algorithms
## Deep Learning
- DL is a subset of ML wherein the algorithms are inspired by biology (mathematical representation of biological structures such as neurons)
- Deep Learning is suited for application on unstructured data
- **Unstructured data** is data that is available in the form of natural language, images, etc that needs to be processed or converted to structured data
- In the context of unstructured data, neural networks can be applied for deep learning 
- DL does not require pre-defined features to be provided and instead it is capable of detecting features on its own. Thus DL can be used in scenarios where the features are unknown
- The benefit of DL is that the more data you provide the DL algorithm, the better predictions it can make
### Common DL Algorithms
- Examples:
	- Neural networks
	- Fully connected neural network
	- Convolutional neural network
	- RecUrrent neural network
	- Transformer
