# Overview

- DL — Deep Learning | ML — Machine Learning | AI — Artificial Intelligent
- ML and DL are often interchangeably used to refer to the same thing (i.e, deep learning) since DL is a subset of ML

- ML and DL allow us to solve problems without explicitly defining every single rule that can transform a set of inputs into a set of outputs
- Should ML/ DL be used anywhere and everywhere? The answer is that if the problem at hand can be solved fairly simply using traditional programming then we needn't use ML. Thus ML should be used when a problem requires a large number of complex rules to be enforced
- ML is capable of learning or adapting to continually changing environments; it can also be used to infer information from large collections of data
## Limitations of ML
- While ML models can interpret patterns, they cannot be represented easily in a form that is understandable to humans and as a result in certain scenarios where it is necessary for the human to understand the pattern ML will prove to be not so useful (this is the typical case)
- ML models have the probability of producing errors and hence must be avoided in scenarios where errors are unacceptable
- When the data available is limited, ML models may not be suitable to solve the problems although there are techniques to implement ML models in such cases
