# Fundamentals
---
- *Neural networks* are mathematical expressions which take some constant data and variable weights as input and the predictions are the outputs of the neural network or loss function
- The idea of a neural network is to mimic the functioning of neurons in the human body through a mathematical model

 > Often times the terms `pattern`, `embedding`, `weights`, `feature representation` and `feature vectors` are used to refer to similar things
