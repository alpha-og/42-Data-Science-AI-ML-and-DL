# Encoding Inputs
---
- In some cases, the inputs cannot be directly passed into a neural network since the values of inputs do not have any inherent meaning
- To overcome this we can encode the inputs in a desired fashion
- Method of Encoding:
	1. one_hot encoding
	2. look up table encoding
## One_Hot Encoding
- This involves conversion of input data into a vector ($n$ dimensional) of suitable size where each dimension has a value of 0 or 1
- The vector produced generally consists of a single entry having the value 1 while all other entries are 0
- The entry having value 1 is representative of the input value
- The size of the vector produced is generally equal to the size of the vocabulary (total number of features that need to be encoded)
> [!note] What is a multi-hot encoding?
> When more than one elements of the vector in the aforementioned encoding take up a value of 1, it is said to be a multi-hot encoding
## Look Up Table Encoding
- This involves the creation of an `n` dimensional array, the rows of which correspond to each value being encoded
