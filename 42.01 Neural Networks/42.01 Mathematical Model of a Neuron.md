# Mathematical Model of a Neuron
---
- The mathematical model for a neuron is as follows: ![[Pasted image 20230213171234.png]]
- $w_i$: weights | $x_i$: input data 
- The $i^{th}$ weight is multiplied with the $i^{th}$ input and then each of those are added up to obtain the *weighted sum*, and a bias is added to it $$\Sigma\ {w_{i}x_{i}} + b$$
- The weighted sum is then passed through an *activation function* (also called *loss function*) which is generally a squashing function (sigmoid/ tanh..etc...). The squashing function helps limit the values of outputs from $-1$ to $1$
- The result from the previous step is the output $$Output = f\bigg(\Sigma\ w_{i}x_{i}+b
	\ \bigg)$$

> - A sigmoid function is a function which squashes the inputs to a small range of values
> - The tanh function is a hyperbolic tangent function
- The weights are the strength of the individual synapses and determine the degree of influence of each corresponding input on the output
- The *bias* ($b$) is an inherent unique property of each neuron that has an influence on the output
