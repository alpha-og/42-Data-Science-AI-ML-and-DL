# Gradients
---
- To create a good Neural Network (NN) model, it is important to draw a relation between the inputs and outputs and the impact of inputs on the outputs
- For this purpose, we take the derivative of the output with respect to the input values which gives us a gradient
- Generally, we take the derivative with respect to the weights as opposed to the raw input data. This is due to the simple fact that in the real world the inputs are beyond our control.
- Doing this simple operation lets us know if the output value will increase or decrease in response to a change in the input value (generally the weights)
