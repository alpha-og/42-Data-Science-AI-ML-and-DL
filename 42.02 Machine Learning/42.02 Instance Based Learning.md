# Instance Based Learning
---
- In **instance based learning**, the model does not learn anything from the data, instead it makes predictions based on similarity with already available data
- Similarity can be quantified using distance of input point from other points in the dataset.
- An example of such an algorithm is KNN (K nearest neighbours)
- Since predictions are made based on dataset, the dataset needs to be kept and this leads to increase storage usage in the case of instance based learning
