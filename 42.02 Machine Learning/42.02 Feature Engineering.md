# Feature Engineering

- Feature engineering involves the following aspects:
	1. Feature Transformation
	2. Feature Construction
	3. Feature Selection
	4. Feature Extraction
## Feature Transformation
- Feature transformation involves the transformation or change of available data to a form that would prove to be much more apt for the ML algorithm
- This includes:
	- missing value imputation
	- [[42.02 Feature Encoding|Feature Encoding]]
	- outlier detection
	- [[42.02 Feature Scaling|Feature Scaling]]
### Missing Value Imputation
- Missing values in datasets can cause undesirable outcomes with the ML models and in order to avoid such scenarios we must fill the missing values with values such as the mean, median, etc... 
### Outlier Detection
- Outliers are those values which are extremely different from the rest of the dataset and their removal leads to greater [[42.02 Generalisation|generalisation]] of the model ^01b500
- Removal of outliers is a rather simple process, however their detection can be difficult as often times we are unaware of which data points may act as outliers unless we analyse the data
### Handling Mixed Data
- Reference video: https://youtu.be/9xiX-I5_LQY
- Mixed data is data that contains information that is both categorical and numerical. 
- Examples of Mixed Data: 
	- Seat number such as D15 where D maybe indicative of the section of the vehicle and 15 is the 15th seat in that section
	- Sometimes the same column may have categorical and numeric data (different entries have either categorical or numeric data in the same column)
- In order to handle mixed data we must split the categorical and numeric components programmatically into separate columns. The logic for the same will have to be made based on the structure of the data
### Handling Date and Time Data
- Reference Video: https://youtu.be/J73mvgG9fFs
- Whenever dates or time are present in the dataset, make sure to convert them to datetime objects as by default they are encoded as string objects
- Date and time have more data embedded in them as we may infer several different things from them such as:
	- Is it a weekend?,
	- Is it a leap year?,
	- Which month of the year is it?,
	- Which week of the month is it?,
	- Which part of the day does the entry refer to?, etc...
## Feature Construction
- Feature construction involves creation of new features using already available features
- An example of this is [[42.02 Feature Crosses|feature cross]]
- The process of feature construction is an intuition driven process which is akin to an art since there is no definitive method to follow
## Feature Selection
- Feature selection is the process of selecting or plucking out useful features from a large array of features
- Feature selection can greatly speed up the time taken to train models
- However, it is important to note that picking the right features is necessary to produce desirable outcomes
## Feature Extraction
- Feature extraction helps in reducing the number of features by introducing a new feature altogether that covers the purpose of those features it replaces
- Some algorithms used in this process are: PCA, LDA, TSME
