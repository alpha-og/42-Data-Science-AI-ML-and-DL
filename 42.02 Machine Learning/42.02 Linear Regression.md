# Linear Regression
---
- The following are the types of Linear Regression:
	1. Simple Linear Regression
	2. Multiple Linear Regression
	3. Polynomial Linear Regression
- Processes involved:
	1. Appropriate [[42.02 Representation|representation]] of data
	2. Obtaining the [[42.02 Loss|loss]] function during training and minimising it
	4. [[42.02 Generalisation|Generalisation]]
	5. [[42.02 Regularisation|Regularisation]] (if required)
- Considering the general equation of a line (Univariate Linear Regression) in 2-d space, $$y=wx+b$$ where $w$ represents the slope (weight in the context of machine learning) and $b$ represents the constant (bias in the context of machine learning)
- A more general representation of the above equation (Multivariate Linear Regression) in the context of machine learning would be as follows $$y=\overset{n}{\underset{i=0}\Sigma}{(w_ix_i)}+b$$ where $y$ is the label value, $b$ is the bias, $n$ is the total number of features and, $w_i$ and $x_i$ are the weight and feature value corresponding to $i^{th}$ feature

- The loss for a given input and output, in linear regression, is the distance of the line from that datapoint
- The $L_2$ loss is a convenient loss function for regression. It is the square of individual deviations $$L_{2}\ Loss_{i} = (y_{actual}-y_{pred})^2$$
- In the context of machine learning, we ideally wish to minimise loss with respect to every example as opposed to just a single example. As a result we resort to taking the sum or mean of the individual $L_2$ losses $$L_{2}\ Loss = \Sigma{(y_{actual}-y_{pred})^2}$$ OR $$L_{2}\ Loss = \frac{\Sigma{(y_{actual}-y_{pred})^2}}{N}$$ where $N$ is the total number of observations/ predictions
- **Mean Squared Error** or **MSE** is the average squared loss per example across the entire dataset and is given as follows $$= \frac{\Sigma{(y_{actual}-y_{pred})^2}}{N}$$ where $N$ is the total number of examples
- MSE is commonly used in ML but it isn't a silver bullet

## Multiple Linear Regression
- **Multiple Linear Regression** problems have more than one inputs and a single output
