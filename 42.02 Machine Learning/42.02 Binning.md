- Discretisation is the process of transforming continuous variables into discrete variables by creating a set of contiguous intervals that span the range of the variable's values.
- A bin is an alternative term for interval
- Binning can be used to:
	- handle outliers
	- improve the value spread
- Types of Binning:
	1. Unsupervised Binning
	2. Supervised Binning
	3. Custom Binning
- The following techniques are used in unsupervised binning:
	1. Equal Width Binning
	2. Equal Frequency Binning
	3. K-Means Binning
- The technique used in supervised binning is Decision Tree Binning
## Unsupervised Binning
### Equal Width Binning
- aka: Uniform Binning
- The size of the intervals/ bins is determined using the following formula: $$\frac{max-min}{n}$$ where $max$ and $min$ are the maximum and minimum values present in the dataset, and $n$ is the number of bins required
- Equal width binning involves creating a specific number of equal sized bins across the entire range from the minimum to the maximum value. Following this we create a frequency distribution for the dataset using the bins
- Example:
	- Consider a dataset of age of people where the maximum age is 105 and the minimum age is 5
	- We wish to create 10 bins. In this case, the bin size will be $(105-5)/10= 10$ 
	- Thus the bins/ intervals created will be (5-15), (15-25), (25,35), ..., (95-105)
- The impact of outliers is reduced since the outlier becomes part of the bins at the extremes
- The spread of the data does not change
### Equal Frequency Binning
- aka: Quantile Binning
- Equal frequency binning involves creating a specific number of bins such that each bin/ interval has an equal percentage of the total data 
- Example (left is raw data histogram; right is the conditions for quantile binning): ![[Screenshot 2023-08-08 at 1.02.59 PM.png]]
- The plot for the binned data in case of quantile binning will be more or less uniform
- This method of binning is used quite often

### K-Means Binning
- Useful for binning data that is clustered
- In the context of the K-Means algorithm where K-Means binning is used, the intervals are termed as *centroids*

## Custom Binning
- Custom binning involves creating bins based on beforehand knowledge
- The strategy used for binning may not be a standard or widely used technique
- Example: age can be binned into the following bins â€” (0,18)-children; (18,100)-adults;
