# Reinforcement Learning
---
- In **Reinforcement Learning**, there is no data available to the model. The model learns by performing actions and tweaking its internal rules to result in rewards over punishments
- The rewards and punishments are decided beforehand
- Comprises of a decision process
- There is a reward system in place to "reinforce" the learning
- Learning is done through a series of actions
- **Example Usage:** a chess engine (bot) that is rewarded with a win (positive reward) or loss (negative reward) at the end of the game. Thus the model must tune itself to attempt to get a positive reward
