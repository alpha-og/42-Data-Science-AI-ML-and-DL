# Ordinal Encoding
---
- In order to encode input features that are ordinal categorical data, ordinal encoding can be used
- However, if the target is categorical, then instead of ordinal encoding, label encoding is done
- In ordinal encoding, a number is assigned to each unique category such that the number is indicative of its precedence (i.e, categories with higher significance or importance in the context of the problem, are given higher values)
