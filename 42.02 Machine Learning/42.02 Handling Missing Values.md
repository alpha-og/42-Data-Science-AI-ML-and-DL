# Handling Missing Values
---
- Missing values in datasets can cause undesirable outcomes with the ML models and in order to avoid such scenarios we must fill the missing values with values such as the mean, median, etc... 
- The following are the methods of handling missing values:
	1. Complete Case Analysis (CCA)
	2. Imputation
## Complete Case Analysis
- Aka: list wise deletion of cases
- CCA involves discarding observations (rows) in which the values of one or more variables (columns) are missing
- CCA literally translates to analysing only those observations for which there is information in all of the variables in the dataset
- However, this approach is less desirable since we would be throwing away the useful data of the other columns in the entry
- **Assumption:** data is missing completely at random (MCAR) â€” CCA is to be done only when this assumption holds true
	- If the assumption is not satisfied and CCA is performed then the data being removed may be possessing missing values by virtue of their characteristics, i.e the missing values are not an anomaly
	- If the assumptions are satisfied and CCA is performed then the removal of the observations is just like leaving out some observations from the dataset at random
- **Advantages:**
	1. Easy to implement as no data manipulation is required
	2. Preserves variable distribution if data is MCAR
- **Disadvantages:**
	1. Use of CCA may lead to exclusion of useful data
	2. The model will not be capable of handling missing data in production (example: in the case of online learning where new data is being added to the dataset in realtime)
- When to use CCA? (all conditions must be met)
	- Data is MCAR
	- If less than $5\%$ of the dataset observations has missing values
## Imputation
### Imputation of Numeric Data
- Types of Imputation of Numeric Data:
	1. Univariate Imputation
	2. Multivariate Imputation
[[42.02 Univariate Imputation]]

#### Multivariate Imputation
- Univariate Imputation involves filling of missing values using the already available values in two or more columns of the dataset
- Techniques of Multivariate Imputation:
	1. KNN Imputation
	2. Iterative Imputation
