- **Definition (informal):** "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." ~Arthur Samuel (1959)
- There are various types of ML which are enlisted here: [[42.02 Types of ML]]
## Terminology
- **Label**(output) is the variable we're predicting; Typically represented by the variable **y**
- **Features**(inputs) are input variables describing our data; Typically represented by the variables $\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$
- **Example** is a particular instance of data
	- **Labelled examples** are used to train the model (features are known, labels are known)
	- **Unlabelled examples** are used to make predictions (features are known, labels are unknown)
- **Model** produces a relation between the features (inputs) and labels (outputs) of the training dataset and helps predict outcomes in the test dataset
- **Training** is the process or act of creating/ learning the model. The process involves showing the model some labeled examples and enabling the model to change different parameters to correctly produce relationships.
- **Inference** is the application of trained model to unlabelled examples
- **Hyperparameters** are the configuration settings (weights, biases, etc...) used to tune how the model is trained ^bacd7b
- **Underfitting** is the scenario when the ML model is unable to function effectively both on training dataset and test dataset ^3d1d7f
- **Overfitting** is the scenario when the ML model is able to function effectively on training dataset but is unable to be effective against the test dataset (low loss but poor predictions against previously unseen inputs) ^1e2789
- **Non-Convex problems:** In most cases of neural networks there exists more than one local minima and as a result the initialisation values of the weights and biases can have an influence on the loss produced by the model
- **Convex problems:** These are situations where there exists a single local minima and the loss is independent of the initialisation values of the weights and biases
- **[[42.02 Loss|Loss]]** is a measure of how well the model can predict the output, when it is given an input
- Consider a scenario where value A and B are said to be positive class and negative class respectively:
	1. **True Positives** (TP) are predictions which correctly predict a given input to be A
	2. **False Positives** (FP) are predictions which incorrectly predict a given input to be A
	3. **True Negatives** (TN) are predictions which correctly predict a given input to be B
	4. **False Negatives** (FN) are predictions which incorrectly predict a given input to be B
