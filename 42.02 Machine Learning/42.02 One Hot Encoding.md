# One Hot Encoding
---
- OHE is used for encoding nominal categorical data, since ordinal encoding can cause the model to incorrectly assume priorities for the data even though there is no definite order
- OHE creates a vector that has as many dimensions as the number of unique categories in the input feature
- *Dummy Variable Trap:*
	- When using OHE, we must make sure that the encoded input features are independent of each other (as the inputs are *independent variables*) to avoid multi-collinearity
	- In order to overcome this we can simply drop any one of the columns (i.e, total number of columns in the final encoded inputs will be `n-1` where `n` is the total number of nominal categorical data columns prior to encoding). This is effective due to the dependence being removed and the data still represents the original data since we can continue to interpret the removed column's data based on the new encodings

- Tackling datasets whose nominal categorical data have a large number of distinct categories:
	- If we were to proceed with traditional OHE, the encoded inputs would have a large dimensionality which can increase storage requirements and decrease computation speed
	- In order to minimise the resource requirements, after performing OHE of required inputs, we may discard the categories which occur very rarely and group them into a separate class such as `others`
	- This helps in reducing dimensionality
