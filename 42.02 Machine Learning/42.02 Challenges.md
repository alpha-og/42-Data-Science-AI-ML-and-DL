# Challenges
---
## Data Collection
- Two approaches to collecting data when data is not readily available:
	1. Using APIs
	2. Using web-scraping

## Insufficient Data/ Labelled Data
- In many cases, an inferior algorithm can make better predictions than a superior algorithm if the inferior algorithm is presented with vastly more data than that given to the other algorithm
- As a result, it is possible to achieve great efficiency and accuracy of predictions just by virtue of having more data
- However, in the real world, the challenge is that we may not always have sufficient amount of data to solve a problem

## Non Representative Data
- Sometimes, the dataset we possess may have incomplete data or may not be truly representative of the entire dataset
- When the data collected does not include one or more portions of the entire actual or true data, it leads to **sampling noise**
- When the data collected results in a biased data, it leads to **sampling bias**
- Such situations which arise due to lack of comprehensive data can create or produce biases in the ML model and sway the predictions in undesirable directions

## Quality of Data
- Many factors such as incomplete or missing feature values, etc... can contribute to poor quality of data
- More than half the time spent in creating an ML model is spent on cleaning up data and deriving useful features from it

## Irrelevant Features
- If irrelevant features are passed as input to the ML algorithm, the predictions made are also likely to be irrelevant

## Overfitting
- Overfitting arises when the ML model adjusts to the peculiarities of the training dataset and is able to predict values for previously seen inputs from the training set with high accuracy, but is unable to do so against previously unseen inputs
- Overfitting leads to poor [[42.02 Generalisation|generalisation]] and in a way it is akin to [[42.02 Instance Based Learning|instance based learning]]

## Underfitting
- Underfitting arises when the ML model is unable to predict values for previously seen inputs from the training set and is also unable to predict values for new unseen inputs

## Software Integration
- The ML model, at the end of the day, must be integrated into a product such that it makes sense
- ML models on their own cannot prove to be useful and only through appropriate integration with software can they be utilised to their best potential
- Software integration is not easy since ML is stable on only a few platforms or languages. Quite a lot of hacking and tinkering around is required for successful software integration

## Offline Learning/ Deployment

## Cost Involved
- The cost of making ML models and running them can rack up with increasing scale
