# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---
- Techniques:
	1. Univariate Analysis
	2. Bivariate Analysis
	3. Multivariate Analysis
- Every column or feature in a dataset can be termed as a variable
- The python modules `seaborn` and `matplotlib` are used for EDA
- Seaborn documentation: https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html#objects-api
- Matplotlib documentation: https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/index.html
## Data
- Data can be classified into two types, **numerical** (age, height, etc...) and **categorical** (gender, region, etc...)
- Categorical Data can further be classified into nominal and ordinal categorical data
- **Nominal** categorical data are those data which possess no order or sequence like state or gender or courses ^0012b7
- **Ordinal** categorical data are those data which possess a definite order such as categories of academic excellence (average, good, excellent, etc...) ^dbf8ae

## Univariate Analysis
- Video reference: https://youtu.be/4HyTlbHUKSw
- Involves analysis of a *single variable*
- When handling categorical data you can perform the following (you may perform other operations as well):
	1. obtain a frequency distribution of each distinct category in the dataset
	2. Plot bar-graphs, histograms or pie-charts
- When handling numerical data you can perform the following (you may perform other operations as well):
	1. Plot bar-graphs, histograms, distplots, boxplots, etc...

## Multivariate Analysis
- Video reference:  https://youtu.be/6D3VtEfCw7w
- Three distinct scenarios:
	1. Numerical - Numerical Plots
	2. Numerical - Categorical Plots
	3. Categorical - Categorical Plots
