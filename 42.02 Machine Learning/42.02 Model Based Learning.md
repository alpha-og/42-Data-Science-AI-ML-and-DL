# Model Based Learning
- In **model based learning**, the model draws a mathematical relation between the inputs and outputs and uses the relation to make predictions
- Example: Linear regression, decision tree
- Since predictions are made using the model, the training dataset can be discarded after training the model and thus in the case of model based learning, less storage space is required
