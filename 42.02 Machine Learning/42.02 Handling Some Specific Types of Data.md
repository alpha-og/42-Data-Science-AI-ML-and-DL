# Handling Some Specific Types of Data
---
## Handling Mixed Data
- Reference video: https://youtu.be/9xiX-I5_LQY
- Mixed data is data that contains information that is both categorical and numerical. 
- Examples of Mixed Data: 
	- Seat number such as D15 where D maybe indicative of the section of the vehicle and 15 is the 15th seat in that section
	- Sometimes the same column may have categorical and numeric data (different entries have either categorical or numeric data in the same column)
- In order to handle mixed data we must split the categorical and numeric components programmatically into separate columns. The logic for the same will have to be made based on the structure of the data
## Handling Date and Time Data

- Whenever dates or time are present in the dataset, make sure to convert them to datetime objects as by default they are encoded as string objects
- Date and time have more data embedded in them as we may infer several different things from them such as:
	- Is it a weekend?,
	- Is it a leap year?,
	- Which month of the year is it?,
	- Which week of the month is it?,
	- Which part of the day does the entry refer to?, etc...
