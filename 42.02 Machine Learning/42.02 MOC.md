- Start here: [[42.02 Introduction]] to develop a fundamental understanding of ML and get an idea about commonly used terminology 
- Learn about the types of ML here: [[42.02 Types of ML]]
- It is crucial to understand the [[42.02 Applications]] and [[42.02 Challenges]] (or limitations) of ML, before delving further
- One of the most commonly used learning methods is [[42.02 Supervised Learning]] and is used for two distinct kinds of ML tasks, namely, [[42.02 Regression]] and [[42.02 Classification]]
- The [[42.02 MLDLC]] covers the *Life Cycle* of a machine learning project from start to finish and is quintessential to developing an efficient and effective ML based product
- Use the MLDLC page to navigate to other relevant sections such as data acquisition, cleanup, model creation, feature engineering etc...
