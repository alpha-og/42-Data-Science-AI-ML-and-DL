# Unsupervised Learning
---
- Data is not labeled (the outputs corresponding to the inputs are unknown in the training dataset)
- There is no feedback
- Hidden structure/ pattern in input dataset has to be determined
- **Goal:** to identify a pattern or structure within a dataset when the outcomes are unknown (un-labeled) without a reward function
- **Types:**
	1. Clustering
	2. Dimensionality Reduction
	3. Anomaly Detection
	4. Association Rule Learning
## Different Algorithms/ Use Cases
- The following are various algorithms that are put to use under unsupervised learning:
	1. Clustering
	2. Anomaly Detection
	3. Dimensionality Reduction
- **Example Usage (clustering):** clustering is an [[42.02 EDA]] technique that organises data into clusters without any prior information about their membership.

- **Example Usage (dimensionality reduction):** involves reducing the number of feature dimensions. An example is the removal of `no of rooms` and `no of washrooms` features from a housing dataset to create a single new feature `sqr ft area` since the number of rooms and washrooms in essence lead to increase in square ft area (called feature extraction)
- **Example Usage (Anomaly Detection):** finding unusual data points
- **Example Usage (dimensionality reduction):** can be used to visualise `n` dimensional data in 3d or 2d space
- **Example Usage (Association Rule Learning):** data can be mined to identify co-relations between features. An example is the use of unsupervised learning to analyse purchases made at a store and identify that whenever product A is purchased, product B is also purchased
