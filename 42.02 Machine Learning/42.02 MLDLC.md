# Machine Learning Development Life Cycle (MLDLC)
---
- MLDLC or MLDC is the start to finish process through which an ML based product is created
- Steps
	1. [[42.02 Problem Framing|Problem Framing]]
	2. Data Collection
	3. Data Preprocessing
	4. [[42.02 EDA|Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)]]
	5. [[42.02 Feature Engineering|Feature Engineering]]
	6. Model Training, Evaluation and Selection
	7. Model Deployment
	8. Testing
	9. Optimisation
- Data Preprocessing can involve:
	- Removal of duplicate entries
	- Removal of outliers
	- Scaling
- EDA can involve:
	- Data visualisation
	- Univariate/ Bivariate/ Multivariate analysis
	- Outlier detection
	- Handling imbalance
## Understanding your Data
- It is important to ask the right questions and analyse the data in hand before going further in the MLDLC
- Important Pointers:
	1. How big is the data? (use `df.shape`)
	2. How does the data look like? (use `df.head` or `df.sample(n)`)
	3. What is the datatype of each column? (use `df.info()`)
	4. Are there any missing values? (use `df.info` or `df.isnull().sum()`)
	5. How does the data look, mathematically? (use `df.describe()`) — mean, min, max, etc...
	6. Are there any duplicate values? (use `df.duplicated().sum()`) — duplicates can be removed using the `df.dropduplicates()` method
	7. What is the correlation between different columns? (use `df.corr()`) — gives a value between 1 and -1 that points to how related two columns are — you can index with column names to get correlation with respect to that specific column
## Use of Pipelines (Sci-Kit Learn)
- We may have to repeat certain steps of the MLDLC whenever a prediction is to be made or whenever the model is to be trained. This can turn out to be inefficient and tedious at scale
- In order to overcome this challenge we may use pipelines wherein there is a predefined process through which all data is passed through
- The idea behind pipelines is that the same data is passed through a series of connected processes without having to fragment or isolate each step
