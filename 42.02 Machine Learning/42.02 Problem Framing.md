# Problem Framing
---
- Problem framing involves the interpretation of a business problem as an ML problem
- In the next few sections we'll be going over the process of problem framing through the example of a hypothetical scenario at Netflix (the process is valid for any problem)
## Mathematical Intuition
- **Thought Process:** Determine how the problem can be converted to a mathematical form
- Churn rate: the fraction of active users who stop using/ buying a product/ service over a fixed period of time such as a month, year, etc...
- Higher churn rates lead to decreasing revenue. The growth rate of the company must counter-act the churn rate in order for the company to remain in business in the long run
- Thus, when the problem of increasing profits in a company arises, decreasing the number of people leaving the active user base is one way to do so, in addition to other ways like increasing the number of active customers or charging the active customers more
- Mathematically this would translate to decreasing the churn rate of the company
## Identifying the Type of the Problem
- **Thought Process:** Determine which type of ML algorithm/ model would be suitable for the problem after considering the required results from the model
- The type here refers to the [[42.02 Introduction#Types of ML based on Supervision Required|type of ML model]] to be used
- Identification of the type of the problem involves having an idea of the end result/ product to be made so as to address the problem
- In the context of the aforementioned example, the end result is a decreased churn rate for the company. We needn't be concerned with the prediction of churn rates (this is the responsibility of other developers). In order to decrease the churn rate, we would first require to identify which customers are most likely to leave the user base
- The problem in hand may seem like a classification task, where our goal is to predict whether a given customer will churn or not. However on taking a closer look, we find that it would better if we can predict the probability of each customer churning and hence we can provide different incentives for the customer to stay with the company based on the probability of them leaving the user base. Thus regression would be better suited for this problem
## Dig into the Current Solution
- **Thought Process:** understand existing solutions, identify the points of failure and produce better solutions
- Learn about currently implemented strategies to combat the problem
## Data Acquisition
- **Thought Process:** Determine the various metrics and data that can be utilised to solve the problem
- For our example, Netflix would have data about watch time, search queries, clicks, etc...
- We can use this data, find relations between available data, find relations between the data and the required outcome, etc... and feed our model with the appropriate features
## Choosing Metrics to Measure
- **Thought Process:** Determine the metrics that can be used to measure the efficacy of our solution
- In order to analyse the performance of the solution proposed and determine its impact, different metrics have to be used
## Choosing the Type of  Runtime Environment
- **Thought Process:** determine which [[42.02 Types of ML#Based on Runtime Environment|runtime environment]] is suitable for the problem
## Check Assumptions
- **Thought Process:** Re-evaluate the data/ features chosen, the metrics chosen for performance measurement, etc...
