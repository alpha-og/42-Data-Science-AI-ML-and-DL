# Batch Learning
---
- In **batch learning**, the model is trained on the entire dataset
- This kind of learning is generally performed offline (hence, why this learning is also called **offline learning**) due to the cost and resources required
- The model is trained offline/ locally and the trained model is the deployed on the server to make predictions
- Advantages:
	1. Lowers expense associated with allocating server resources
	2. Efficient and will ensure that the server resources are available for other tasks
- Disadvantages:
	1. The model is static and cannot learn from new data as it has already been trained locally
	2. In order to update the model, it has to be trained again locally on the new data and the new model has to be re-uploaded to the server
	3. Since training is done on the entire dataset, if the dataset is very large then training could take very long periods
