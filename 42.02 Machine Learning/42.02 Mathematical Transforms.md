# Mathematical Transforms
---
- Mathematical transforms are any mathematical operations performed on the dataset so as to make the data normally distributed
- The need for mathematical transforms arises from the fact that datasets may not always be normally distributed
- Some common Mathematical Transforms are:
	1. Log Transform
	2. Reciprocal Transform
	3. Power Transform
	4. Box - Cox Transform
	5. Yeo - Johnson Transform
- Determining if the data is normally distributed or not:
	1. Plot it using `seaborn` (`sns.distplot()` method) (OR)
	2. Use Pandas (`pd.skew()` method) (OR)
	3. Use QQ Plot (if the plotted pointes is at on or above the 45 degree mark then it is normally distributed â€” read on about qq plots later)
- Mathematical Transforms have to be applied by trial and error with the end goal of normalising the data
## Log Transform
- *Use case:* normalisation of right skewed data
- *Limitation:* cannot be used on negative values (since logarithm cannot be applied on negative values)
- Log scale makes the intervals uniform and thus helps normalise the dataset
- Log transform is useful in improving performance linear regression models as they require or assume that the dataset is normally distributed
## Power Transform
- Square Transform is used for normalising left skewed data
- Square Root Transform can also be used for normalisation (no specific use case)
