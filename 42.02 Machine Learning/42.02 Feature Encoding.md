## Encoding Categorical Features
- In cases where the data refers to categories such as different animals or age groups, it becomes necessary to convert the categorical data into an encoded form which is numerical
- The converse may also be required depending on the situation
- [[42.02 Introduction#Data|Categorical data]] is usually in the form of strings which cannot be directly used in an ML algorithm
- Two of the most common encoding techniques:
	1. [[42.02 Ordinal Encoding|Ordinal Encoding]] (used for handling [[42.02 EDA#^dbf8ae|Ordinal Categorical Data]])
	2. [[42.02 One Hot Encoding|One Hot Encoding]] (used for handling [[42.02 EDA#^0012b7|Nominal Categorical Data]])
## Encoding Numerical Features
- While numerical data can be passed into ML models directly, it may not always be the best way to tackle the problem
- Sometimes numerical data becomes more useful when they are encoded into categories.
- There are two techniques of encoding numerical features:
	1. [[42.02 Binning|Binning ]]
	2. Binarisation
