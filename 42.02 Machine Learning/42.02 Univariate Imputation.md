# Univariate Imputation
---
- Univariate Imputation involves filling of missing values using the already available values in the same column
- Statistical techniques may be performed on the values of the column and the resultant values are used to fill the missing values in the same column
- The following are the most common techniques of Univariate Imputation where missing values are filled with:
	1. mean/ median values
	2. arbitrary values
	3. end of distribution values
	4. random values
## Mean/ Median Imputation
- The missing values of a column are replaced with the mean or median of the same column in which the values are missing
- Filling the missing values with the mean value is suitable when the distribution is symmetric
- However, if the distribution of the dataset is skewed, prefer the usage of median as median is less sensitive to the presence of outliers
- When to use? (all conditions must be met)
	- Data is [[42.02 Handling Missing Values#^226961|MCAR]]
	- If less than $5\%$ of the dataset observations has missing values
- **Advantages:**
	1. This technique is very simple
	2. Easy to implement
- **Disadvantages:**
	1. Distorts the shape of the distribution
	2. Outliers may be produced
	3. Co-variance/ Correlation of data can change
- Whenever performing mean/ median imputation:
	- the variance of the data for the column may shrink (this is expected behaviour, however drastic shrinking of variance must be avoided)
	- the co-variance/ correlation may change
	- the IQR may shrink due to more values being present in middle of the dataset and as a result datapoints which were previously not outliers will become outliers (create box plots to analyse the same)
- **Preferred Use Case:** numeric data

## Mode Imputation
- The missing values of a column are replaced with the mode of the same column in which the values are missing
- When to use? (all conditions must be met)
	- Data is [[42.02 Handling Missing Values#^226961|MCAR]]
	- If less than $5\%$ of the dataset observations has missing values
- **Advantages:**
	1. This technique is very simple
	2. Easy to implement
- **Disadvantages:**
	1. Distorts the shape of the distribution
	2. Outliers may be produced
	3. Co-variance/ Correlation of data can change
- **Preferred Use Case:** categorical data

## Arbitrary Value Imputation
- The missing values of a column are replaced with an arbitrary value
- This technique is often used with missing categorical data (by replacing NA values with the string "Missing")
- In case of missing numeric values, any value maybe assigned to replace the missing value
- The main goal with arbitrary value imputation is for the model to be able to distinguish between the available data and missing data
- Suitable for use when it is known that data is not [[42.02 Handling Missing Values#^226961|MCAR]]
- **Advantage:** Easy to implement
- **Disadvantages:**
	1. Distorts the shape of the distribution
	2. Outliers may be produced
	3. Co-variance/ Correlation of data can change
- **Preferred Use Case:** numeric data
## End of Distribution Imputation
- The missing values of a column are replaced with values present at the end of the distribution
- It is an extension of arbitrary value imputation
- The common values used are:
	1. $\overline{x}\pm3\sigma$ (in case of normally distributed data) — Reasoning: [[64.01 Distributions#^2cc1e8|distribution of values in terms of SD]]
	2. $Q1-1.5IQR$ or $Q3+1.5IQR$ —IQR proximity (in case of skewed data)
- Suitable for use when it is known that data is not [[42.02 Handling Missing Values#^226961|MCAR]]
- **Advantage:** Easy to implement
- **Disadvantages:**
	1. Distorts the shape of the distribution
	2. Outliers may be produced
	3. Co-variance/ Correlation of data can change
- **Preferred Use Case:** numeric data
## Labelling Data as "Missing"
- The missing values are replaced with a new category called "Missing"
- **Advantage:** Easy to implement
- **Disadvantages:**
	1. Distorts the shape of the distribution
	2. Outliers may be produced
	3. Co-variance/ Correlation of data can change
- **Preferred Use Case:** categorical data
## Random Value Imputation
- The missing values of a column are replaced with non-null values selected randomly from the same column
- Suitable for use in linear algorithm based models
- Unsuitable for use in tree algorithm based models
- **Advantages:** 
	1. Easy to implement
	2. Shape of distribution remains similar or same (since the probability of occurrence of specific values changes by very small amount)
	3. Variance does not change significantly
- **Disadvantages:** 
	1. Covariance/ Correlation of data can change
	2. Memory intensive (training set has to be kept in memory in order to replace missing values in the data in case of online learning)
## Missing Indicator
- For every column that has missing values, a new column is created which has boolean values representing the presence (true) or absence (false) of values in the corresponding column
