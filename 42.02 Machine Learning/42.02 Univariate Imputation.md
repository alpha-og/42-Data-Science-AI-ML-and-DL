# Univariate Imputation
---
- Univariate Imputation involves filling of missing values using the already available values in the same column
- Statistical techniques may be performed on the values of the column and the resultant values are used to fill the missing values in the same column
- The following are the most common techniques of Univariate Imputation where missing values are filled with:
	1. mean/ median values
	2. arbitrary values
	3. end of distribution values
	4. random values
## Mean/ Median Imputation
- The missing values of a column are replaced with mean or median of the same column in which the values are missing
- Filling the missing values with the mean value is suitable when the distribution is symmetric
- However, if the distribution of the dataset is skewed, prefer the usage of median as median is less sensitive to the presence of outliers
- **Advantages:**
	1. This technique is very simple
	2. It is easy to implement
- **Disadvantages:**
	1. Distorts the shape of the distribution
	2. Outliers may be produced
	3. Co-variance/ Correlation of data can change
- When to use? (all conditions must be met)
	- Data is MCAR
	- If less than $5\%$ of the dataset observations has missing values
- Whenever performing mean/ median imputation:
	- the variance of the data for the column may shrink (this is expected behaviour, however drastic shrinking of variance must be avoided)
	- the co-variance/ correlation may change
	- the IQR may shrink due to more values being present in middle of the dataset and as a result datapoints which were previously not outliers will become outliers (create box plots to analyse the same)
