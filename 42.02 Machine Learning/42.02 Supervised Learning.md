# Supervised Learning
---
- Data is labeled (the outputs corresponding to the inputs are already known and available in the training dataset)
- Feedback from the model in the form of loss functions are used to fine-tune the model
- Can be used to predict outcomes when a certain input is passed whose outcome is unknown at the time of passing the inputs
- This type of learning is widely used in real world applications and has seen rapid advancements in the recent past
- In supervised learning, a machine learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and attempts to find a model that minimises [[42.02 Loss|loss]]; this process is calledÂ **empirical risk minimisation**.
- **Goal:** to create a model using labeled training data and predict outcomes in the future
- **Types:**
	1. [[42.02 Regression|Regression]] Analysis: involves prediction of outcomes based on available data by producing a curve that best represents the situation using a best fit curve (the curve has to be such that its distance from every data point is minimum)
	2. [[42.02 Classification|Classification]] Task: involves classifying inputs into different categories
- **Example Usage (classification task):** making a spam filter model that can correctly classify e-mails as spam or not after training the model with correctly *labeled* emails (spam or not spam)
- **Example Usage(regression analysis):** making a model that can predict the scores that are achievable by students on the basis of the number of hours they study
- **Some more example use cases:** ![[Screenshot 2023-06-28 at 1.36.47 PM.png]]
- Generally, regression is used when the prediction to be made is [[42.02 Introduction#Data|numerical]] and has a wide range of possible prediction values . In contrast, classification is used when the prediction to be made is [[42.02 Introduction#Data|categorical]] and there is a small limited number of possible predictions
