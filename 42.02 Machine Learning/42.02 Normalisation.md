- **Normalisation** is the technique of changing feature values without distorting their ranges or the information conveyed by them while making sure that the various features use a common scale
- In essence, normalisation aims to remove the units that can often be a part of data such as weights, height, distances, temperatures, etc...
- Some common normalisation techniques are:
	1. Min-Max Scaling
	2. Mean Normalisation
	3. Max Absolute Scaling
	4. Robust Scaling
	5. For more examples see the sci-kit learn [docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html)
### Min-Max Scaling
- Min-Max scaling is done using the following formula: $$x^{'}_{i}=\frac{x_i-x_{min}}{x_{max}-x_{min}}$$
- Since the minimum value of $x_i$ is $x_{min}$, the range of $x^{'}_i$  is $[0,1]$ because when $x_{i}=x_{min}$, $x^{'}_{i}$ will be 0 and when $x_i=x_{max}$ the numerator and denominator cancel out to give unity
- Geometric understanding:
	- The feature values, prior to normalisation, on plotting will lie in an arbitrary position occupying an arbitrary area or volume
	- After normalisation the feature values are squished to occupy a smaller area and their values become in the range of $[0,1]$

- Limitations:
	- In some cases, the shape of the distribution maybe altered upon normalisation
	- Since the range of values of the feature is being squished to $[0,1]$, the impact of outliers also gets squished
### Mean Normalisation
- **Mean Normalisation** is done using the following formula: $$x^{'}_{i}=\frac{x_i-\overline{x}}{x_{max}-x_{min}}$$
- Mean normalisation centres the data about its mean (somewhat similar to standardisation)
- The resultant feature values are in the range $[-1,-1]$
- Rarely used

### Max - Absolute Scaling
- **Max - Absolute Scaling** is done using the following formula: $$x^{'}_{i}=\frac{x_i}{|x_{max}|}$$
- Used when data is represented in [[42.02 Representation#^f1c9e8|sparse representation]] or where the data consists of many 0s

### Robust Scaling
- **Robust Scaling** is done using the following formula: $$x^{'}_{i}=\frac{x_i-x_{median}}{IQR}$$ where IQR is the **Inter Quartile Range** (75th%ile - 25th%ile)
- Generally suitable for scaling data that contains outliers, but needn't always be useful
